      <h1>Soma Client Terms of Service</h1>
      <div class="effective">Effective Date: August 10, 2025</div>
    </header>

    <p>Welcome to Soma. These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a legal agreement between you (“you” or “the client”) and <strong>Soma Health Solutions Inc.</strong> (“Soma,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). Please read them carefully before using the Soma mobile app (“the App”).</p>

    <div class="callout" aria-label="Agreement confirmation">
      <p>By creating an account, using the App, or clicking “I Agree,” you confirm that you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have read and understood these Terms.</li>
        <li>Consent to the practices described here.</li>
        <li>Are legally able to give consent (or have a guardian who can do so).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="purpose">1. Purpose of Soma</h2>
    <p>Soma is a digital tool designed to support mental health professionals in their work and to give you optional self‑tracking features. Soma is <strong>not</strong> a medical device and does not diagnose, treat, or prevent conditions. All clinical decisions remain with your mental health provider.</p>

    <div class="callout" aria-label="Free app summary">
      <p><strong>Free App Users:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can use Soma without connecting to a provider.</li>
        <li>All journal entries stay anonymous and encrypted on your device.</li>
        <li>You can optionally enable cloud backup for the same device (for recovery after reinstall) by contacting <a href="mailto:support@soma-health.ca">support@soma-health.ca</a>.</li>
        <li>Journal details remain encrypted and unreadable by Soma unless you opt in for anonymized product improvement.</li>
        <li>Soma is for personal use only and does not share your data with anyone unless you choose to connect with a provider.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="anonymity">2. Anonymity</h2>
    <p>In this document, “anonymous” means Soma does not store or link your personal identifiers (such as name or email) to your app data.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you sign up, we do not collect your name, email address, or other direct identifiers.</li>
      <li>If you connect to a provider, your provider uses an alias (for example, “Client A”) that cannot be used to identify you in our systems.</li>
      <li>Your provider may store your real identity in their own secure clinical records — we cannot access this.</li>
      <li>Our servers may receive your IP address in routine server logs, but we do not use or access IP logs to identify you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="consent">3. Optional Features &amp; Consent</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All features that involve sharing or collecting personal or sensitive information are <strong>off by default</strong>.</li>
      <li>You choose which features to enable.</li>
      <li>You can turn off sharing at any time in the App settings.</li>
      <li>Disabling a feature stops future sharing but does not delete data already shared with your provider.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="audio">4. Audio Recording Consent</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Audio recording is not available in the free version.</li>
      <li>It is only available through the provider web portal if you are connected to a provider.</li>
      <li>If you and your provider choose to record a session for transcription purposes, this agreement acts as your explicit consent for that recording.</li>
      <li>Recordings are used only to create a transcript for clinical note drafts.</li>
      <li>Recordings are automatically deleted after <strong>25 days</strong>.</li>
      <li>Session notes, transcripts, and recordings will never be used for any other purpose without your additional consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="data-collected">5. Data Collected Through the App</h2>
    <p><strong>Journal responsibly</strong> — do not include personal identifying information in your journal entries.</p>
    <p>Depending on which features you enable or use, Soma may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Anonymous mood and stress ratings.</li>
      <li>Anonymous time, date, and duration of activities.</li>
      <li>Anonymous completion status of activities.</li>
      <li>Anonymous encrypted activity details.</li>
      <li>Anonymous encrypted journal entries (only if you explicitly consent to share them).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We never sell or share your data with third parties. Your data always remains anonymous, even if you consent to decryption of activity details and journal entries to improve the product and features.</p>

    <h2 id="wearables">6. Wearable Device Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Wearable features are not available in the free version.</li>
      <li>They are only available if you have connected to a provider who enables them for you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your provider requests wearable device data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can choose whether or not to connect a device.</li>
      <li>If you connect, we may collect anonymous data such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, breathing rate, sleep, temperature, and activity levels.</li>
      <li>Your wearable account credentials are encrypted — we do not decrypt them even if you consent to using your data for product improvement.</li>
      <li>Wearable data will only be summarized and shared with your provider if you consent to connect a wearable.</li>
      <li>The scope of what you choose to grant is your 'activity', 'heartrate', 'oxygen_saturation', 'respiratory_rate', 'sleep', 'temperature', nothing else.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="privacy">7. Data Use &amp; Privacy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We never access your encrypted journal or activity text unless you have explicitly chosen to allow us to decrypt it for product improvement.</li>
      <li>We comply with Canadian privacy laws (<strong>PIPEDA</strong>).</li>
      <li>Your sensitive data (journal text, activity details, session notes, transcripts, wearable credentials) is encrypted.</li>
      <li>We only use this data to improve the product if you have explicitly opted in.</li>
      <li>Anonymous aggregated data may be used to improve Soma’s features, but only with your consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="storage">8. Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All data is stored on secure servers in Canada.</li>
      <li>All transcription and related processing is done on private servers with immediate deletion (“zero‑day retention”).</li>
      <li>No prompts or session content are logged.</li>
      <li>All data sent to these servers is provider de‑identified and client‑anonymous.</li>
      <li>Encrypted data cannot be read without your consent to share it.</li>
      <li>We use industry‑standard safeguards to protect your information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="provider">9. Connecting to Your Provider</h2>
    <p>If you choose to connect the App to your provider:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data sharing does not constitute real-time communication with your provider. Shared data is reviewed when your provider conducts clinical work and incorporated into documentation as needed for service delivery.</li>
      <li>You decide what to share.</li>
      <li>Your provider is responsible for storing and using that information according to their professional standards and legal obligations.</li>
      <li>Disconnecting stops future sharing but does not delete past data from your provider’s records.</li>
      <li>You always remain anonymous to Soma — your provider must alias you in our system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="medical">10. No Medical Advice</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The App may provide insights, summaries, or tools to help you track your wellbeing.</li>
      <li>These are for information only and are not medical advice.</li>
      <li>Always consult your provider for clinical decisions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="responsibilities">11. Your Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>When using the App, you agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use it only for lawful purposes.</li>
      <li>Do dot attempt to reverse engineer, disrupt, or misuse the App.</li>
      <li>Keep your device secure and your access credentials private.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="changes">12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We may update these Terms from time to time.</li>
      <li>We will notify you in the App and by posting the updated Terms with a new “Effective Date.”</li>
      <li>If you keep using the App after changes take effect, you accept the new Terms.</li>
