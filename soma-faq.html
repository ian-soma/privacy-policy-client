class="c11 doc-content"><h1 class="c4" id="h.oc9jk5gy686e"><span class="c12">SOMA HEALTH SOLUTIONS INC. &ndash; FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)</span></h1><p class="c2"><span>This FAQ outlines key information about Soma Health Solutions Inc., our AI-driven platform, and our commitments to ethics, privacy, and clinical utility. It is intended to support mental health professionals and organizations in understanding how Soma is used and how we operate.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.ju1b20yjygw1"><span class="c7">GENERAL &amp; REGULATORY</span></h2><h3 class="c0" id="h.lrwv48mz3suk"><span class="c3">Are you medico-legally approved?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Soma is not classified as a medical device under any jurisdiction, including Health Canada or the FDA (U.S.). However, we actively engage with legal, clinical, and regulatory stakeholders to ensure our platform meets the highest standards of safety, transparency, and ethical oversight. Soma does not make clinical decisions; all outputs are drafts or suggestions intended to assist professionals, who retain full responsibility for client care. Consent templates and usage protocols reinforce this approach.</span></p><h3 class="c0" id="h.1tdr9zfzyo5y"><span class="c3">What stage is Soma currently at?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Soma is at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7, meaning the system is being demonstrated in an operational environment and is transitioning toward scalable deployment. It is currently in pilot with early partners and is transitioning toward limited commercial release. &nbsp;Soma will be entering the market in a phased approach, first with clinician workflow focused tools, then with activity and program delivery to the client, then with advanced AI features. &nbsp;Each of these phases will be offered as a pilot / pilot extension, upgrade then release structure.</span></p><h3 class="c0" id="h.fdfdrn3izy15"><span class="c3">Is Soma still in research, pilot, or ready for market?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>Soma is in pilot and early deployment. While no longer in internal R&amp;D, it is still undergoing active iteration with real-world feedback. &nbsp;We are offering a pilot for our first iteration, which will be focused on clinician workflow. &nbsp;We are considered market ready, we offer the pilot so that we can gather early feedback so our market launch will be as strong as possible.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.q3h488ijvhv1"><span class="c7">PRIVACY &amp; DATA</span></h2><h3 class="c0" id="h.od2gvpt1p14m"><span class="c3">Do you sell data to third parties?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Absolutely not. Soma does not sell, trade, or monetize personal, health, or usage data. Third-party access is limited to service delivery (e.g., hosting, processing) and governed by strict confidentiality agreements.</span></p><h3 class="c0" id="h.154ahh5k4t8c"><span class="c3">Where is my data stored?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All data is stored securely in Canadian data centers, complying with PIPEDA and supporting regional privacy frameworks like HIPAA, and PHIPA as applicable. &nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c0" id="h.7p77g4fx8ew0"><span class="c3">Where is the data physically stored?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Physically, data is stored in secure, high-compliance facilities located in Canada. No identifiable data is transferred outside Canada without lawful safeguards.</span></p><h3 class="c0" id="h.86tlb1skp7rd"><span class="c3">Who has access to the consultation information?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Only the licensed professional using Soma can access their consult data. Internal access is tightly restricted to authorized technical staff and only for maintenance or support, data use is controlled with opt-in user permission. &nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c0" id="h.asp5nc10jp8p"><span class="c3">What are the restrictions on client data used for training?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Client data is never used for model training without opt-in consent. We do not train on raw client sessions or journal content unless it is explicitly flagged by the user for opt-in research or feature improvement. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">What are the restrictions on professional data used for training?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Soma may analyze professional inputs such as template changes or editing styles in fully de-identified, aggregate form to improve usability and draft quality. No personally identifiable professional data is used for training. &nbsp;We do not train on professional data content unless it is explicitly flagged by the user for opt-in research or feature improvement. &nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c0" id="h.oa1aaikdubbk"><span class="c3">Do you have a consent template for therapists to give to clients?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>Yes. Soma provides a Client Consent Template that therapists can include in their processes. It covers client awareness and consent for recordings, journaling, and data privacy, emphasizing transparency and voluntary participation.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.rnjyxlyixig3"><span class="c7">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</span></h2><h3 class="c0" id="h.ohuhnwwsg1ii"><span class="c3">What data have you used to train the AI?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Our AI is developed in collaboration with science-focused large language model providers (e.g., Anthropic), using a mix of publicly available and licensed datasets. Soma&rsquo;s proprietary components are trained exclusively on anonymized user and system usage data. Importantly, user data is only used for training if the user has explicitly opted in.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>As of now, Soma has not released any models trained on user data. We are committed to full transparency regarding our training sources, testing procedures, and release plans during any pre-release phase. For more details, please refer to our Terms of Pilot or Software-as-a-Service agreement.</span></p><h3 class="c0" id="h.ntf7v8juerba"><span class="c3">Are there populations that might be excluded in this data?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Like most large AI systems, training data may underrepresent certain cultures, languages, or marginalized groups. Soma is actively building validation methods&mdash;including practitioner and client opt-in surveys&mdash;to identify and address bias or blind spots.</span></p><h3 class="c0" id="h.itqaww6rtovq"><span class="c3">Am I able to train the AI for my own preferences?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You can&rsquo;t fine-tune the model directly yet, but your edits, templates, and feedback influence how Soma adapts to your workflow. Personalized tools (e.g., note structure, terminology preferences) are currently in development. &nbsp;Further, custom AI preferences are currently in research and development.</span></p><h3 class="c0" id="h.89m6lr3y7tp5"><span class="c3">What is the extent of your predictive measures?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Soma does not predict diagnoses or outcomes. Its AI is designed to summarize sessions, assist with documentation, and support workflow.</span></p><h3 class="c0" id="h.o68fe2urmpm"><span class="c3">Does it only use individual data to determine suggested practices, or does it use population-based data as well?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Currently, Soma uses generalized language models and does not generate personalized treatment recommendations. Future population-level analytics will be opt-in, anonymized, and used only to inform practitioner decisions. </span></p><h3 class="c0" id="h.e61b594yk4lo"><span class="c3">Is there any diagnostic relevance to the output?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>No. Soma does not suggest or infer diagnoses. All AI-generated content is designed to support, not replace, clinician judgment and must be reviewed and approved by the professional before use.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.j40khbwlqury"><span class="c7">CLINICAL IMPACT &amp; USABILITY</span></h2><h3 class="c0" id="h.wgicq07ij60r"><span class="c3">What does your data say about the clinical relevance for this app for clients (e.g., decrease in anxiety symptoms)?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Our early feedback shows promise in reducing clinician burnout, improving session focus, and streamlining documentation. Formal studies on clinical outcomes (e.g., symptom reduction, therapeutic alliance) are in progress. Soma is committed to independent validation through ethics-approved research and peer-reviewed publication. &nbsp;We are currently in an HREA approved trial that is focused on data collection of anxiety signals from individuals. &nbsp;Further research will be announced post approval with HREA.</span></p><h3 class="c0" id="h.8t98cjmtdqjm"><span class="c3">What is the accuracy of the recommendations/client notes?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>Soma is designed to save time by producing well-structured first drafts, not to replace professional judgment or editing. &nbsp;Our accuracy will grow with your feedback, however, early results show that in most cases little editing is needed. &nbsp;Please review all AI output for accuracy, all AI can make mistakes.</span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.r33l17poqu4"><span class="c7">SYSTEM DESIGN &amp; SAFETY</span></h2><h3 class="c0" id="h.urj72rgsm6io"><span class="c3">Does the AI make autonomous decisions?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No. Soma&rsquo;s AI has no independent agency. It cannot make clinical decisions, initiate actions, or offer treatment recommendations. All content generated by the system is created only in response to practitioner input, such as note generation, summarization, or documentation prompts.</span></p><h3 class="c0" id="h.qsviq03u0bn2"><span class="c3">Can the AI provide diagnoses or treatment suggestions?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No. As per Soma&rsquo;s Terms of Use, all AI-generated content is strictly a suggestion and must be interpreted as such by the licensed professional. Any phrasing that may appear clinical is generated as a draft to support documentation only, and is not to be taken as a diagnosis, treatment plan, or therapeutic direction. It is the responsibility of the professional to review, interpret, and revise all content before it is used in a clinical or client-facing context.</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c0" id="h.h1k3lnli1mae"><span class="c3">What safeguards are in place to prevent misuse?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Audit logs: System activity is logged to support transparency and accountability in usage.<br></span></p><h3 class="c0" id="h.kze19tcmshem"><span class="c3">What are the programming restrictions?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Soma&rsquo;s system is built under strict ethical and legal boundaries:</span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_nx3tb8x7i0kh-0 start"><li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">It cannot store or process identifiable health information.</span></li><li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">It cannot access or transmit data beyond approved secure environments.</span></li><li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">It is prohibited from autonomous behavior, including initiating interactions or making decisions without direct user instruction.<br></span></li></ul><h3 class="c0" id="h.3rhyrz21h02s"><span class="c3">Is the system designed to comply with regulatory standards?</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yes.
