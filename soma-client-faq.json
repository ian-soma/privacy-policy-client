        {
          "question": "What is Soma Client?",
          "answer": "Soma Client is a secure, anonymous journaling app designed to give you a private space to express yourself freely. All entries are searchable, making it easy to review them before clinical appointments or personal reflection."
        },
        {
          "question": "How is it secure?",
          "answer": "Soma Client stores all journals locally in an encrypted space on your device. Data never leaves your phone unless you choose to share it. Even if synced to our cloud, entries remain encrypted and anonymous. Your passcode is bound to your device, ensuring your data cannot be accessed elsewhere."
        },
        {
          "question": "Anonymous app – can it do everything a modern app can?",
          "answer": "Soma Client offers most modern features while remaining fully anonymous. Some limitations exist: it only works on one device at a time, and switching devices requires exporting and importing your data manually. If you lose your passcode, recovery isn’t possible—you’ll need to reinstall and start fresh. We recommend storing your passcode securely, such as emailing it to yourself for safe reference."

        {
          "question": "How do I get my data / switch phones?",
          "answer": "Go to Settings > Data Management > Export Data to save your journals as a .json file. Email this file to yourself, set up Soma Client on your new device, then use Settings > Data Management > Import Data to restore your entries."

          "question": "What is the Mental Health Professional area of Soma Client?",
          "answer": "In Canada, Soma Client can be paired with a Mental Health Professional, allowing you to securely share your journal entries with them."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I share some journals and not others?",
          "answer": "Not yet. Currently, you must delete any entries you don’t wish to share. More flexible sharing options are planned for future updates."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is Auto-Approve Data Sharing?",
          "answer": "This option lets you automatically share journal entries with your Mental Health Professional instead of approving each request. Individual users can ignore this setting, but enabling it also allows Soma to use your anonymous data to improve features more quickly."

      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "What is Enable Voice Commands?",
          "answer": "This feature lets you record journals by voice using carefully selected third-party transcription services. These services do not use your data and only retain it briefly (3–5 days) for technical purposes. Transcriptions are processed in real time, then encrypted and stored securely on your device."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is Data Usage Consent?",
          "answer": "With your consent, Soma can use anonymous journal data to improve the app. This helps us identify user needs, refine features, enhance usability, and train better tools like search and voice transcription. Your data always remains encrypted and anonymous."
